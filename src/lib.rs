#![deny(missing_docs, unsafe_code)]
//! A Rust crate for creating ABCI applications.
//!
//! ## ABCI Overview
//!
//! ABCI is the interface between Tendermint (a state-machine replication engine) and your application (the actual state
//! machine). It consists of a set of methods, where each method has a corresponding `Request` and `Response` message type.
//! Tendermint calls the ABCI methods on the ABCI application by sending the `Request` messages and receiving the `Response`
//! messages in return.
//!
//! ABCI methods are split across 3 separate ABCI connections:
//!
//! - `Consensus` Connection: `InitChain`, `BeginBlock`, `DeliverTx`, `EndBlock`, `Commit`
//! - `Mempool` Connection: `CheckTx`
//! - `Info` Connection: `Info`, `SetOption`, `Query`
//!
//! Additionally, there is a `Flush` method that is called on every connection, and an `Echo` method that is just for
//! debugging.
//!
//! To know more about ABCI protocol specifications, go to official ABCI [documentation](https://tendermint.com/docs/spec/abci/).
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Add `abci-rs` in your `Cargo.toml`'s `dependencies` section:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! abci-rs = "0.9"
//! ```
//!
//! Each ABCI application has to implement three core traits corresponding to all three ABCI connections, `Consensus`,
//! `Mempool` and `Info`.
//!
//! > Note: Implementations of these traits are expected to be `Send + Sync` and methods take immutable reference of `self`.
//! So, internal mutability must be handled using thread safe (`Arc`, `Mutex`, etc.) constructs.
//!
//! After implementing all three above mentioned `trait`s, you can create a `Server` object and use `Server::run()`to start
//! ABCI application.
//!
//! `Server::run()` is an `async` function and returns a `Future`. So, you'll need an executor to drive `Future` returned
//! from `Server::run()`. `async-std` and `tokio` are two popular options. In `counter` example, we use `tokio`'s executor.
//!
//! To know more, go to `examples/` to see a sample ABCI application.
//!
//! ### Features
//!
//! - `use-tokio`: Enables `tokio` backend for running ABCI TCP/UDS server
//!   - **Enabled** by default.
//! - `use-async-std`: Enables `async-std` backend for running ABCI TCP/UDS server
//!   - **Disabled** by default.
//!   
//! > Note: Features `use-tokio` and `use-async-std` are mutually exclusive, i.e., only one of them can be enabled at a time.
//! Compilation will fail if either both of them are enabled or none of them are enabled.
//!
//! ## Minimum Supported Versions
//!
//! - Tendermint: [`v0.33.4`](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/releases/tag/v0.33.4)
