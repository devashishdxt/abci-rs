/// Note that [`check_tx`] doesn't have to check everything that affects transaction validity; the expensive things can
/// be skipped. In fact, [`check_tx`] doesn't have to check anything; it might say that any transaction is a valid
/// transaction. Unlike [`deliver_tx`], [`check_tx`] is just there as a sort of weak filter to keep invalid transactions
